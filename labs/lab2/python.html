                <p>Python is a super high level language, meaning that is has very limited control of the computer memory specifically. However, python is not designed for such work, and is the choice language for multimedia productions amd scripting, as it has the ability to work well with all sorts of different media, from images to video. Additionally, this language is ideal for beginners, as the syntax is much more simple than any of its mainstream competitors. </p>
