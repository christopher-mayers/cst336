                <p>Java is similar to C++ in it's wide variety of use cases, but the amount of lower level control that this language has is much lower. However, this language excels in compatibility and portability, due to the way in which the way this language runs is standardized for all processing units. This means that Java can run on anything from a large scale computer to small integrated devices. </p>
